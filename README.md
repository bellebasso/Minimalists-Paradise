Minimal, but not too simple. Inspired by [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) and [Border](https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border), the main attraction of Minimalists Paradise is a card layout with customizable features via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. Never lose track with the safari tabs (inspired by [this snippet](https://github.com/gavinmn/obsidian-theme/blob/main/safaritabs.css)) which also match your color accent! Enable or disable colored headers with different preset options or create your own.

**WARNING**: As of now, some things are not completely optimized for light mode (including some visual inconsistencies in reading mode), such as dataview tables styling and custom callouts. However, other features (such as vanilla callouts, markdown tables, blockquotes and citations, etc) work as expected in light mode in both reading and live mode.

# Features
## Colored Headers
Give your notes a little color with the colored headers! Choose between different presets or create your own custom combinations.

## Color Accent Override
Does your color accent look perfect in dark mode, but not that good in light mode? With Minimalist's Paradise you can choose between using the vanilla color accent or assigning different colors and tones per theme. This way your theme will always be it's best.

## Extended Color Schemes
Minimalist's Paradise is minimal, but not boring. Choose between different presets for both light and dark mode, in an integrated interface via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. (This looks even better with the Color Accent Override turned on!)

## Customizable Features
Customize colors, fonts, syntax highlighting and blockquotes. A little freedom, without being overwhelming.

## How to install?
### Via the community themes store
1. Go to Settings > Appearance > Themes > Manage
2. Click on "Use community theme" > Browse
3. Search for "Minimalists Paradise"
### Manually
1. Clone this repo into your .obsidian/themes folder
2. If the theme does not show up in the Obsidian interface, check to see if the name of the folder is "MinimalistsParadise"(common issue). If that's the case, rename the folder to "Minimalists Paradise"and refresh the app. This should solve the problem.
3. For updating with this method, navigate to your .obsidian/themes/Minimalists Paradise inside the terminal and execute git pull.

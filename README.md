Minimal, but not too simple. Inspired by [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) and [Border](https://github.com/Akifyss/obsidian-border), the main attraction of Minimalists Paradise is a card layout with customizable features via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. Never lose track with the safari tabs (inspired by [this snippet](https://github.com/gavinmn/obsidian-theme/blob/main/safaritabs.css)) which also match your color accent! Enable or disable colored headers with different preset options or create your own.

> **WARNING**: As of now, some things are not completely optimized for light mode (including some visual inconsistencies in reading mode), such as dataview tables styling and custom callouts. However, other features (such as markdown tables, blockquotes and citations, etc) work as expected in light mode in both reading and live mode.

> For a full showcase of all the different features, color schemes and such please refer to the [documentation](https://minimalists-paradise-docs.vercel.app)

## Showcases
> **Disclaimer**: **ALL** showcases have the color accent override setting turned on, this works on a light mode/dark mode basis. This is totally optional, but, even though it takes away a little bit of freedom and customizability, it does make the color schemes look and feel more consistent (as shown below).
### Default Dark Mode

## Color Accent Override
Does your color accent look perfect in dark mode, but not that good in light mode? With Minimalist's Paradise you can choose between using the vanilla color accent or assigning different colors and tones per theme. This way your theme will always be it's best.

> This setting works in a light mode/dark mode basis and is particularly useful for the Extended Color Schemes. There are a lot of things that rely on the color accent (such as table headers, active tabs, citations, highlights, all types of links and more). Therefore, it is recommended to keep this setting on for a better visual, specially regarding the Extended Color Schemes.

## Infobox callouts
Make your notes aesthetic and interactive with the infobox callouts (inspired by and adapted from [this snippet](https://github.com/Avyrra/Infobox-Callouts?tab=readme-ov-file)).

> This is integrated to use the theme colors. If you prefer to use the original snippet with all the customization features, disable the infobox section via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

## Tabbed callouts
Create callouts with tabs for better navigation (inspired by and adpated from [this snippet](https://github.com/r-u-s-h-i-k-e-s-h/Obsidian-CSS-Snippets/blob/Collection/Snippets/Callout%20styling%20-%20Tabbed%20callout.md)).

> This is integrated to use the theme colors. If you prefer to use the original snippet, disable the tabbed callout section via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

## Extended Color Schemes
Minimalist's Paradise is minimal, but not boring. Choose between different presets for both light and dark mode, in an integrated interface via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. (This looks even better with the Color Accent Override turned on!)
